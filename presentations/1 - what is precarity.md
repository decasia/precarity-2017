"What does it mean even to propose that a spreading precarity provides the dominant *structure* and *experience* of the present moment, cutting across class and localities?"

(Lauren Berlant, *Cruel Optimism*, p. 192)

# Who is precarious?

"There is broad agreement on the emergence of this situation, but descriptions of the affected populations veer wildly from workers in regimes of immaterial labor and the historical working class to the global managerial class; neobohemians who go to university, live off part-time or temporary jobs, and sometimes the dole while making art; and, well, everyone whose bodies and lives are saturated by capitalist forces and rhythms."

---

# What sort of thing is precarity?

"In what sense, then, is it accurate to call this phenomenon a new global class... termed the *precariat*? This emergent taxonomy raises questions about to what degree precarity is an economic and political condition suffered by a population or by the subjects of capitalism generally; or a way of life; or an affective atmosphere; or an existential truth about contingencies of living, namely, that there are no guarantees that the life one intends can or will be built."

# Precarity and capitalism

"At root, precarity is a condition of dependency - as a legal term, *precarious* describes the situation wherein your tenancy on your land is in someone else’s hands. Yet capitalist activity always induces destabilizing scenes of productive destruction - of resources and of lives being made and unmade according to the dictates and whims of the market. But, as David Harvey and many others argue, neoliberal economic practices mobilize this instability in unprecedented ways."

---

"The profit interests of the owners of neoliberal capital are served by the shrinkage of the social welfare state, the privatization of... publicly held utilities and institutions, the increase in... pension insecurity, and the ever more “flexible” practices of contractual reciprocity between owners and workers... Add to this the global transformation of unions from a force driving forward security and upward mobility to administrative entities managing workers’ decreasing legitimacy for claims-making on profit and security, and you get a broad picture of the neoliberal feedback loop..."
